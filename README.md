# 📦 Decentralized Google Drive (Web3 + IPFS)

A fully decentralized, Web3-based image upload and sharing platform — built using **Solidity**, **IPFS**, **React.js**, and **MetaMask**. It mimics core features of Google Drive but ensures that **users own their data**, stored securely on the **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)** and managed via **Ethereum smart contracts**.
